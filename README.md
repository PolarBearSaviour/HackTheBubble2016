The game I made (or mainly broke) with Jack, Jamie and Rafael

## Details 
The game was written in pure JS (with no libraries being used). The game radomly generates levels (thanks to Rafael's algorithm) with
player having to escape the burning buidling (loosely based of the CS labs in St Andrews). The fire was implemented by Jack. Jamie implemenmated 
the collision and movement systems. I implemented the graphics system. All the art in the game was drawn by Owen.
